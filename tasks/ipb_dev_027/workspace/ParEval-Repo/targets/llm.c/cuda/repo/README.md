# llm.c

LLMs in simple, pure C/CUDA with no need for 245MB of PyTorch or 107MB of cPython. Current focus is on pretraining, in particular reproducing the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) and [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) miniseries. You'll recognize this file as a slightly tweaked [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), an earlier project of mine. Currently, llm.c is a bit faster than PyTorch Nightly (by about 7%). The main code is in [train_gpt2_fp32.cu](train_gpt2_fp32.cu). I'd like this repo to only maintain C and CUDA code. Ports to other languages or repos are very welcome, but should be done in separate repos, and I am happy to link to them below in the "notable forks" section. Developer coordination happens in the [Discussions](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions) and on Discord, either the `#llmc` channel on the [Zero to Hero](https://discord.gg/3zy8kqD9Cp) channel, or on `#llmdotc` on [GPU MODE](https://discord.gg/gpumode) Discord.

## quick start

The best introduction to the llm.c repo today is reproducing the GPT-2 (124M) model. [Discussion #481](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/discussions/481) steps through this in detail. We can reproduce other models from the GPT-2 and GPT-3 series in both llm.c and in the parallel implementation of PyTorch. Have a look at the [scripts README](scripts/README.md).

debugging tip: when you run the `make` command to build the binary, modify it by replacing `-O3` with `-g` so you can step through the code in your favorite IDE (e.g. vscode).

## quick start (1 GPU, fp32 only)

If you won't be training on multiple nodes, aren't interested in mixed precision, and are interested in learning CUDA, the fp32 (legacy) files might be of interest to you. These are files that were "checkpointed" early in the history of llm.c and frozen in time. They are simpler, more portable, and possibly easier to understand. Run the 1 GPU, fp32 code like this:

```bash
chmod u+x ./dev/download_starter_pack.sh
./dev/download_starter_pack.sh
make train_gpt2fp32cu
./train_gpt2fp32cu
```

The download_starter_pack.sh script is a quick & easy way to get started and it downloads a bunch of .bin files that help get you off the ground. These contain: 1) the GPT-2 124M model saved in fp32, in bfloat16, 2) a "debug state" used in unit testing (a small batch of data, and target activations and gradients), 3) the GPT-2 tokenizer, and 3) the tokenized [tinyshakespeare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt) dataset.


## test

I am also attaching a simple unit test for making sure our C code agrees with the PyTorch code. Compile and run with:

```bash
make test_gpt2fp32cu
./test_gpt2fp32cu
```

This now loads the `gpt2_124M_debug_state.bin` file, runs a forward pass, compares the logits and loss with the PyTorch reference implementation, then it does 10 iterations of training with Adam and makes sure the losses match PyTorch. 

The test should pass and print `overall okay: 1`.

# repo

A few more words on what I want this repo to be:

First, I want `llm.c` to be a place for education. E.g. our `dev/cuda` folder is a place for a library of kernels for all the layers that are manually hand-written and very well documented, starting from very simple kernels all the way to more complex / faster kernels. If you have a new kernel with various different tradeoffs, please feel free to contribute it here.

That said, I also want `llm.c` to be very fast too, even practically useful to train networks. E.g. to start, we should be able to reproduce the big GPT-2 (1.6B) training run. This requires that we incorporate whatever fastest kernels there are, including the use of libraries such as cuBLAS, cuBLASLt, CUTLASS, cuDNN, etc. I also think doing so serves an educational purpose to establish an expert upper bound, and a unit of measurement, e.g. you could say that your manually written kernels are 80% of cuBLAS speed, etc. Then you can choose to do a super fast run, or you can choose to "drag and drop" whatever manual kernels you wish to use, and run with those.

However, as a constraint, I want to keep the mainline `llm.c` in the root folder simple and readable. If there is a PR that e.g. improves performance by 2% but it "costs" 500 lines of complex C code, and maybe an exotic 3rd party dependency, I may reject the PR because the complexity is not worth it. As a concrete example - making cuBLAS for matmuls the default in the root training loop is a no-brainer: it makes the mainline code much faster, it is a single line of interpretable code, and it is a very common dependency. On the side of this, we can have manual implementations that can compete with cuBLAS in `dev/cuda`.

Lastly, I will be a lot more sensitive to complexity in the root folder of the project, which contains the main / default files of the project. In comparison, the `dev/` folder is a bit more of a scratch space for us to develop a library of kernels or classes and share useful or related or educational code, and some of this code could be ok to be (locally) complex.
