You are a helpful coding assistant. You are helping a software developer translate a codebase from the cuda execution model to the openmp-offload execution model.

The codebase is called microxor. Its path is targets/microXOR/openmp-offload/repo. Given this code repository, translate the microxor codebase's cuda-specific files to the openmp-offload execution model.

The new files should be in C++ and all old cuda files must be deleted. A new Makefile should be made to compile accordingly with the new files.

Ensure that the user can compile this code using, for example, `make SM_VERSION=sm_80 CXX_COMPILER=clang++` to build the code for a system with an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 80 compiled with clang++. Ensure also that the command line interface after translation still works as expected, so that, for example, `./microXOR.exe 1024 32` still works to run the code with a 1024 by 1024 input matrix and a kernel with 32 times 32 threads per block.
