# 📈 AutoLab

AutoLab is a live benchmark for evaluating AI agents on frontier auto research tasks. It currently presents 36 open-ended challenges spanning low-level systems optimization, CUDA kernel optimization, GPU-intensive model development, and puzzle-style algorithmic challenges, each with a real codebase, a compute budget, and a goal to optimize. Instead of measuring one-shot correctness, AutoLab tests what matters in practice: the ability to diagnose bottlenecks, formulate hypotheses, run experiments, and iteratively improve under realistic constraints.

## Environment Setup

We utilize [Harbor](https://github.com/harbor-framework/harbor) to run and evaluate agent tasks in sandboxed containers. To install Harbor, simply:

```bash
uv sync
bash harbor_patch.sh  # enable gpu and extended waiting
```

### Reproducing Benchmark Results

We recommend using the following environments:

- **System Optimization:** To fully reproduce leaderboard experiments, please use AMD Ryzen 9 9950X with 64 GB memory. Differences in instruction set support across CPU generations can affect the maximum achievable speedup. Relative rankings and performance trends nevertheless remain informative.
- **CUDA:** requires H100 GPU access. We highly recommend [Modal](https://modal.com/) or other GPU-enabled container environments.
- **Model Development:** requires H100 or L40S GPU access; we highly recommend [Modal](https://modal.com/) or other GPU-enabled container environments.
- **Puzzle and Challenge:** no specific hardware environment is required.

## Task Structure

Each task gives the agent:

- A working but unoptimized program (not a blank slate but a realistic starting point)
- A fixed compute budget and timeout (1–12 hours depending on task complexity)
- A target metric (throughput, latency, perplexity, accuracy, parameter count, etc.)
- A sandbox (with an H100 or L40S GPU if it requires model training or inference)

The agent must diagnose bottlenecks, propose interventions, execute them, measure results, and iterate — exactly as a human researcher would.

Each task is a self-contained environment with Harbor-compatible format:

```
tasks/<task_name>/
├── task.toml              # Metadata, scoring, resource limits
├── instruction.md         # Agent-facing problem description
├── environment/
│   ├── Dockerfile         # Reproducible container (pinned deps, offline data)
│   └── <editable files>   # The code the agent must optimize (e.g. solve.c, train.py)
├── solution/              # Private — invisible to the agent
│   ├── solve.sh           # Reference solution script
│   └── reference.md       # Full explanation of each optimization opportunity
└── tests/
    ├── test.sh            # Runs benchmark, computes reward, writes reward.json
    └── <verifier scripts> # Correctness checks
```

A typical task instruction:

```markdown
# Multi-Source Visual Math Reasoning via GRPO

Fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B with GRPO to maximize accuracy on MathVista visual math problems.

## Setup

| Item | Path / Value |
|------|-------------|
| Training script | `/app/train.py` (editable) |
| Reward functions | `/app/rewards.py` (editable) |
| Training entrypoint | `bash /app/train.sh` |
| Local eval | `python3 /app/evaluate_local.py` |
| Base model | `/models/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-bnb-4bit` (4-bit quantized) |

## Training Data Sources

| Dataset | Path | Size | Content |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| Geometry3K | `/data/geometry3k/` | ~2400 | Geometric reasoning with diagrams |
| MathVision | `/data/mathvision/` | ~2000 | Competition-level visual math |
| ChartQA | `/data/chartqa/` | ~1500 | Chart/graph understanding |

All datasets use a unified format: `question`, `answer`, `image`.

## Your Goal

Maximize `mathvista_accuracy` on 100 held-out MathVista problems. A retention gate applies: if general VQA accuracy drops more than 10% relative to the base model, the score is zero.

## Evaluation
python3 /app/evaluate_local.py   # quick check (20 MathVista + 10 VQA)

Reward = `your_score / reference_score`. Matching the reference scores 1.0.

## Rules

- Edit only `/app/train.py` and `/app/rewards.py`
- Do NOT modify `/orig/`, or `/models/`
- LoRA adapter must be saved to `/app/output/`
- No external network access
- Single L40S GPU (48GB)
- Time budget: 8 hours
```

## Scoring

`task.toml` defines a baseline and a human-written reference solution. AutoLab uses anchored scores, clipped to `[0, 1]`, with task-specific correctness or feasibility gates where needed:

**System Optimization and CUDA tasks:** Log-scaled speedup with a must-beat-baseline gate:

```
speedup = baseline / agent_score
reward  = clip(0.5 × log(speedup) / log(ref_speedup), 0, 1)
```

**Model Development tasks:** Linear interpolation between the baseline and reference anchors:

```
reward  = clip((agent_score - baseline) / (reference - baseline), 0, 1)   # higher-is-better
reward  = clip((baseline - agent_score) / (baseline - reference), 0, 1)   # lower-is-better
```

**Puzzle & Challenge tasks:** Most use anchored linear scoring; some tasks use log-stretch scoring or add task-specific feasibility gates.

These tasks do not share a single reward formula. Refer to each task's `task.toml` and test harness for the exact scoring rule.

## Usage

### Single Task

```bash
harbor run -p [task folder] -a terminus-2 -m [Your Model Name]
