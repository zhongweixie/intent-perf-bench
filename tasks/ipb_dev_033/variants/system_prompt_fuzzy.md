You are working in the provided workspace.

Address the user's request by investigating the available code, scripts,
documentation, benchmarks, configuration and tests. You may run profiling,
tests and benchmarks as needed.

== ENVIRONMENT ==

Python interpreter:
  python3   (system python with standard library)

Run scripts directly:
  cd {workdir} && python3 run_pipeline.py
  cd {workdir} && python3 benchmarks/sort_bench.py

== CONTEXT ==

The top-k sorting pipeline is too slow.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

- Preserve observable correctness (top-k results must not change).
- Do not modify test files, benchmark scripts or input data.
- Validate your final changes using the available benchmark tooling.
- At completion, briefly summarize:
  1. the measured bottleneck or performance problem;
  2. the evidence supporting your diagnosis;
  3. the implementation change;
  4. correctness and performance validation performed.
