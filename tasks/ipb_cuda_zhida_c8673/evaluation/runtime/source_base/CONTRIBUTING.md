# Contributing
DeepSpeed welcomes your contributions!

## Prerequisites
DeepSpeed uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that formatting is
consistent across DeepSpeed. First, ensure that `pre-commit` is installed from either
installing DeepSpeed or `pip install pre-commit`. Next, the pre-commit hooks must be
installed once before commits can be made:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

Afterwards, our suite of formatting tests run automatically before each `git commit`. You
can also run these manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --files  $(git diff --name-only master)
```
If a formatting test fails, it will fix the modified code in place and abort
the `git commit`. After looking over the changes, you can `git add <modified files>`
and then repeat the previous `git commit` command.

You can also run:
```
make format
```
which will do the same as above, and it'll also automatically build a `venv` python environment if you
don't already have one, which will isolate the requirements of this project from requirements of other projects.

## Testing
DeepSpeed tracks two types of tests: unit tests and more costly model convergence tests.
The model convergence tests train
[DeepSpeedExamples](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples/) and measure
end-to-end convergence and related metrics. Unit tests are found in `tests/unit/` and
the model convergence tests are found in `tests/model/`.

### Unit Tests
[PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is used to execute tests. PyTest can be
installed from PyPI via `pip install pytest`. Simply invoke `pytest --forked` to run the
unit tests:
```bash
pytest --forked tests/unit/
```
You can also provide the `-v` flag to `pytest` to see additional information about the
tests. Note that [pytest-forked](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-forked) and the
`--forked` flag are required to test CUDA functionality in distributed tests. Using
`--forked` is safe because `import deepspeed` no longer initializes a CUDA context;
earlier versions probed CUDA at import time, which poisoned `fork()`.

You can also run:
```
make test
```

### Diff-based CI test selection
Some GPU CI workflows (currently `modal-torch-latest`, which runs `tests/unit/v1/`)
run their modal tests on the merge queue entry instead of on every PR push, to
conserve Modal GPU quota. `ci/tests_fetcher.py` looks at the files your PR
changes, builds an import graph over `deepspeed/` and the `unit` test helpers,
and selects only the tests that could be affected. The selection is previewed on
the PR by a cheap no-secret job and executed once the PR enters the merge queue
(`push` to `master` always runs everything). The full design — and
how to drive and extend it — is in
[`.github/workflows/TEST_SELECTION.md`](.github/workflows/TEST_SELECTION.md).

How it decides:
* It diffs your branch against the base branch's merge-base.
* Each changed Python file is traced *forward* to the tests that import it
  (directly or transitively); those tests are selected.
* It **falls back to the full suite** (never to "no tests") whenever it can't
  safely narrow: a missing base / merge-base, a changed shared fixture, build
  system, CI script, or core runtime file, a deleted module that something still
  imports, or any unexpected error in the selector itself.

Escape hatches:
* **Force the full suite for a push:** put `[test all]` (or `[no filter]`) anywhere
  in a commit message on the branch.
* **Run all by touching infra:** changes to the run-all globs (CI config, build
  system, `deepspeed/__init__.py`, collectives/accelerator, shared fixtures, etc.)
  always trigger everything. See `COMMON_RUN_ALL_GLOBS` / `extra_run_all_globs` in
  `ci/tests_fetcher.py`.
* **Runtime/dynamic deps the import graph can't see** (monkey-patching, plugin
  registries, JIT ops, `deepspeed.initialize()`-time injection) are wired up via
  the curated `DYNAMIC_EDGES` map in `ci/tests_fetcher.py` — add an entry there if
  you find a gap.

Preview/debug locally (pure stdlib, no DeepSpeed install needed):
```bash
# What would CI run for your branch?
python ci/tests_fetcher.py --base origin/master
cat ci/.test_selection/test_list.txt

# Why was a test (de)selected? Prints the import chains.
python ci/tests_fetcher.py --base origin/master --explain
```

> Note: plain PR events never start the modal `deploy` job (it stays skipped to
> conserve GPU quota), and under `pull_request_target` GitHub runs the base branch's
> CI scripts anyway. Merge queue runs also use trusted master for the CI scripts —
> your merged tree is only fetched as the candidate under test — so changes to
> `ci/*` take effect once **merged**; validate them before that via a
> `pull_request`-triggered run or the `modal` CLI.

### Model Tests
To execute model tests, first [install DeepSpeed](#installation). The
[DeepSpeedExamples](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples/) repository is cloned
as part of this process. Next, execute the model test driver:
```bash
cd tests/model/
pytest run_sanity_check.py
```
Note that the `--forked` flag is not necessary for the model tests.

## Developer Certificate of Origin
This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. All contributions to deepspeedai projects
require commits to be signed off with a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)
(DCO) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.

When you submit a pull request, the DCO app will check for the presence of signed commits.
Information about how this check works is here: https://github.com/dcoapp/app?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works

To sign commits, you will need to include `-s` when running `git commit`. For example, `git commit -s -m "Commit message"`. One note, creating PRs via the GitHub interface do not appear to include this option.  If you forget this, clicking on the failing check in your PR will point you to commands you can run to rebase and sign previous commits.

## Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of
Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the
[Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact

## New Feature Contribution Guidelines
Unlike bug fix or improving existing feature (where users usually directly submit a PR and we review it), adding a new feature to DeepSpeed requires several steps: (1) proposal and discussion, (2) implementation and verification, (3) release and maintenance. This general guideline applies to all new feature contributions. Core DeepSpeed team member contributions may complete step 1 internally.

### Step 1: proposal and discussion
We ask users to first post your intended feature in an issue. This issue needs to include:

* A description of the proposed feature.
* A motivation of why it will be useful to DeepSpeed users.
* A rough design of how you implement the feature inside DeepSpeed.
* (Important) Results or planned experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the feature.
  * If this is a general feature applicable to different tasks, we require testing it on at least one CV task (e.g., [CIFAR](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/cifar-10/)) and one NLP task (e.g., [SQuAD](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/bert-finetuning/)). If this is a feature for one kind of task only, it is fine to just test on the specific task.
  * If the feature only affects performance and does not affect training convergence, we require testing on a fraction of training to demonstrate that the training/validation loss are consistent with baseline, and that the performance is better than baseline.
  * If the feature does affect training convergence, we require testing the whole training to demonstrate that the feature achieves better/on-par final model quality and training performance compared to baseline.

Based on the issue we shall discuss the merit of the new feature and decide whether accept or decline the proposal. Once accepted and after we confirm the design and implementation plan, we are ready for step 2.

### Step 2: implementation and verification
Contributor will go ahead and implement the feature, and the DeepSpeed team will provide guidance/helps as needed. The required deliverables include:

* A PR to [deepspeedai/DeepSpeed](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed) including (1) the feature implementation (2) unit tests (3) documentation (4) tutorial
* A PR to [deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples) or [deepspeedai/Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/deepspeedai/Megatron-DeepSpeed) including the examples of how to use the feature (this is related to the planned testing experiments in proposal)
* In the implementation (code, documentation, tutorial), we require the feature author to record their GitHub username as a contact method for future questions/maintenance.

After receiving the PRs, we will review them and merge them after necessary tests/fixes.

### Step 3: release and maintenance
After the PRs are merged, we will announce the feature on our website (with credit to the feature author). We ask the feature author to commit to the maintenance of the feature.
