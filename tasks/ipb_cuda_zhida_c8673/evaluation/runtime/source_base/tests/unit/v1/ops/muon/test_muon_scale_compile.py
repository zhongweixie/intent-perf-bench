"""The aspect-ratio scale has to survive `muon_update` being recompiled for a new shape.

The first call compiles for static sizes. The next shape makes dynamo recompile with symbolic
ones, and inductor then cast both sides of `max(1, rows / cols)` to int64, so a 32 x 12 update
got sqrt(2) instead of sqrt(32 / 12). On CPU that hit every branch. On CUDA it hit the expert and
per-head branches with the standard iteration, where the scale is computed before a graph break.

Each case runs an integer ratio first to force that recompile, then compares against the same
function run eagerly.
