"""A tensor whose own gradient overflowed must not absorb it into its momentum.

Muon folds the gradient into its momentum while the partition is filled, which happens
before the overflow check decides whether to keep the step. With nesterov the blend is
also written back into the gradient in place. One overflow would therefore leave the
momentum non-finite for the rest of the run and make every later step overflow too,
until the scaler reaches its minimum and raises.

The guard is per tensor, and the loss scaler's decision is global: `has_overflow` reduces
`_has_inf_or_nan` over every partitioned gradient and `step()` discards the whole step on
that one flag. So a tensor whose own gradient was finite still advances its momentum on a
step discarded because some *other* tensor overflowed, and that update is thrown away.
`test_a_discarded_step_leaves_every_momentum_where_it_was` pins the whole invariant:
the momentum write is staged while the partition is filled and committed only once the
overflow check has passed, so a discarded step leaves every momentum bit-identical --
including a tensor whose own gradient was finite. That costs one buffer the size of the
momentum per group.
