    ``schedule`` uses the ``[(step, passes), ...]`` format consumed by ``init_schedule``. Validate

    Each entry in ``passes`` is normally a registered pass name; a raw callable is resolved back to
    its name through ``name_registry`` (the ``{name: fn}`` registry) by object identity, and a
    callable registered under more than one name must instead be referenced by name. A pass with no
    registered contract is unconstrained: it requires and provides nothing, so mixed schedules of
    contracted and ad-hoc passes remain valid; it is still checked against conflicts that other
    passes declare. Raises :class:`PassContractError` on the first unmet requirement or conflict.

    Each step is validated independently: DeepCompile resets Dynamo and recompiles from the
    original graph at every launched step (see ``launch_compile_passes``), so capabilities a pass
    provides in one step do not carry over to later steps. A pass must therefore find every
    capability it requires among the passes scheduled earlier within the same step.
