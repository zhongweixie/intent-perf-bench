"""Affine description of how a parameter is sharded.

Universal checkpoint currently decides how to merge a parameter by matching its *name*
against regex categories (vocabulary, row-parallel, fused sub-parameters, ...), so a
layout that no category describes cannot be converted at all. This module describes a
shard geometrically instead: each rank holds a list of affine views of the full tensor,
and the views alone say how to rebuild it.

A piece may carry an invertible elementwise map, but never a reduction. Scaling a block by
a constant is reversible; averaging several elements into one is not, and would leave the
full tensor unrecoverable from the shards. That line is what keeps conversion invertible in
both directions.

See ``deepspeed/checkpoint/affine_ir_spec.md`` for the full specification.

class AffinePiece:
    """A block of elements, described where it lives in the full tensor and in the shard.

    A piece holds the same elements in the same arrangement on both sides, so ``shape`` is
    shared and only the offset and strides differ. Describing the shard side explicitly is
    what lets a piece land somewhere other than the end of the shard: a shard split along
    a column interleaves its pieces row by row, so "append each piece in turn" is not
    enough to say where the elements go.

    The offsets and strides are the arguments of ``torch.as_strided``, so a piece can be
    applied to a tensor without any interpretation step.

    ``locations`` is a set of ranks rather than a single owner because a piece may be
    replicated. Naming one owner here would be a scheduling decision, and the cheapest
    source depends on the topology, which this description does not know about.

    ``scale`` is the factor the shard holds the block by: ``shard == full * scale``. Row
    parallel layers pre-divide a replicated bias by the world size so that summing the
    all-reduced outputs adds the bias exactly once, and the divisor changes with the world
    size. Recording it as a number keeps that describable without a rule naming which
    parameters are biases.

    A piece must be *homogeneous*: every element it covers is held by the same set of ranks
    and carries the same scale. That is what makes ``locations`` exact rather than a hint,
    and it is why merging two adjacent blocks is only allowed when both agree.

    ``segments`` is an ordered list of ``(size, replicated)`` pairs covering ``partition_dim``.
    ``split_widths`` gives the per-rank widths of each split segment, in the same order. It is
    required rather than optional because the sizes a layer splits to are not always an even
    division -- they can be aligned to head counts or to a grain size -- and a map built by
    dividing reads the wrong rows while still covering the tensor, so nothing downstream
    notices. Callers pass the widths the partition itself computed.
    A fused QKV weight that shards its query rows but hands every rank the whole key/value
    block is two segments, and the resulting pieces differ in `locations` rather than in
    kind -- which is what the schema could not say before.

    Each segment becomes its own piece precisely because the pieces must stay homogeneous:
    a replicated block sitting next to a rank-private one cannot share a `locations`, even
    where the two happen to be adjacent in the full tensor.
