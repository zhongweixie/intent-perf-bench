"""Selectable transports for the AutoEP expert all-to-all.

The dispatch and combine collectives are the largest single cost in an AutoEP
step, and a measured replay of real routing on 16 H100s across two nodes put
the collective path at 195.8 ms of payload all-to-all per step against DeepEP's
86.3 ms. This module is what lets that be switched without the MoE layer
knowing which transport it is using.

Selection lives in the ``expert_parallel`` section of the DeepSpeed config and
defaults to the collective path, so a job that sets nothing behaves exactly as
before::

    "expert_parallel": {"comm_backend": "comm"}      # default
    "expert_parallel": {"comm_backend": "deepep"}

A backend is asked for once per layer and reused, because DeepEP's buffers are
sized at construction and are expensive to rebuild.
