        """Convert HF tp_plan to DeepSpeed layer specs.

        A style outside SUPPORTED_STYLES raises ValueError and invalidates the whole plan, so a
        style newly introduced upstream fails loudly and gets a deliberate decision rather than
        being dropped on the quiet. Converting only the recognized entries could shard one half
        of a column/row pair, and silently discarding the plan would send models like Llama4 or
        Qwen3 down the heuristic path, which shards by name patterns alone and has no notion of
        the modules the plan deliberately excluded. On Llama4 that path wraps the MoE router,
        whose forward returns a tuple, and breaks the model.

        Supported styles that must stay whole become SKIP specs, which keeps those layers
        untouched on purpose while the rest of the plan is still applied: `embedding_rowwise`,
        because vocabulary-parallel embeddings are not supported yet, and
        `replicated_with_grad_allreduce`, which additionally sums the gradient across the group.

        Returns None only for an empty plan, so the caller can fall back to the existing AutoTP
        path for models that give us nothing to work with.
