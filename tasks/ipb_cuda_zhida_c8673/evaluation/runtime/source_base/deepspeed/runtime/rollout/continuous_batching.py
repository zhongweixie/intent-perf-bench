"""Request scheduling primitives for continuous-batching rollouts.

This module deliberately stops at the scheduler/cache boundary. The model
backend owns prompt prefill and decode; the scheduler reports which old cache
rows survive, which requests retire, and which pending requests can be
admitted into the newly free rows.
