    function exists for backward compatibility and only records TP arguments so
    they can be validated and merged with the DeepSpeed config at initialization.
    When you use both (i.e., calling ``set_autotp_mode(training=True)`` and
    ``deepspeed.tp_model_init`` while also passing the config to
    ``deepspeed.initialize``), DeepSpeed merges the settings at initialization.
    Conflicting settings raise an error. The table below summarizes the behavior
    across input combinations.

    Inputs:
    - TPI: tp_model_init was called? (Y/N)

    Field-level merge rules when both tp_model_init and config exist:
    - Canonical source: config
    - Allowed: fill missing config fields from tp_model_init
    - Error on mismatch: autotp_size, dtype, tp_group size or identity

    Extra checks:
    - If tp_group is provided, reject mpu.
    - If tp_group is not provided, require mpu (or another TP group source).
    - If tensor_parallel is absent and only tp_model_init was called, require
      a TP group source (direct tp_group or mpu).

    Args:
