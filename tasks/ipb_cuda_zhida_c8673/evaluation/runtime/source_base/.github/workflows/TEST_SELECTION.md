# Diff-based CI test selection

This document explains the diff-driven test-selection system that lets some GPU CI
workflows run only the tests a PR could affect, instead of the whole suite, while
still satisfying Required status checks.

It currently drives **`modal-torch-latest`** (which runs `tests/unit/v1/` on
[modal.com](https://modal.com) GPUs), but is built to drive more workflows from
one config — see [Adding a workflow](#adding-a-new-workflow).

## TL;DR

- On a PR, `ci/tests_fetcher.py` diffs your branch against the base branch, traces
  the import graph from your changed files to the impacted tests, and writes the
  list to `ci/.test_selection/test_list.txt`.
- The trusted controller validates that list, then fetches, installs, and tests
  the exact candidate SHA inside a no-secret Modal Sandbox. The Sandbox runs
  only for merge queue entries, `push` to `master` (always the full suite), and
  manual runs — a plain PR event never spends Modal quota.
- It is **fail-safe**: anything it can't reason about safely → run the *full* suite.
  It never silently runs *fewer* tests than reality.
- Preview locally:
  ```bash
  python ci/tests_fetcher.py --base origin/master            # what would CI run?
  python ci/tests_fetcher.py --base origin/master --explain  # ...and why?
  ```
- Force a full run: put `[test all]` (or `[no filter]`) in a commit message.


## Why

`modal-torch-latest` is a **Required** check, so it must report a status on every
PR — which means we can't use GitHub's path filters (`on.<event>.paths`) to skip
it, because a skipped Required job blocks merges. Instead, the job always runs but
*selects* what to test: a docs-only PR resolves to "no impacted tests" and exits
fast (still green), while a PR touching a leaf module runs only the tests that
import it.

The design is a small, self-contained take on HuggingFace `transformers`'
`utils/tests_fetcher.py`.


## Moving parts

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/modal-torch-latest.yml` | The workflow: a no-secret `collect-tests` job gating a trusted `deploy` controller job. |
| `ci/tests_fetcher.py` | The selector. AST-parses the repo, builds an import graph, decides `all` / `subset` / `none`, writes the test-list file, emits a job summary. |
| `ci/test_tests_fetcher.py` | Self-tests for the selector (pure stdlib; run in `collect-tests`). |
| `ci/torch_latest.py` | Pure-stdlib metadata/selection validation plus the trusted Modal Sandbox controller. |
| `ci/.test_selection/test_list.txt` | The hand-off artifact (one pytest target per line). Git-ignored. |

```

`mode` controls `deploy`:

- **`none`** → `deploy` is skipped. The Required status is still satisfied (a
  skipped dependent job counts as success here).
- **`subset`** → `deploy` runs pytest on exactly the impacted files.
- **`all`** → `deploy` runs the whole scope (`tests/unit/v1`).

Independent of `mode`, `deploy` is also skipped on `pull_request_target` runs,
so pushing to a PR never spends Modal quota — the `collect-tests` summary still
previews what the queue will run. The Sandbox actually executes on
`merge_group` (the merged tree, gating the merge), `push` to `master`, and
`workflow_dispatch`. On `merge_group` the candidate is the merge-group commit
in the base repository, diffed against the queue's base SHA, so the selection
covers exactly what the entry would introduce.


## How a decision is made

`TestSelector.select()` in `ci/tests_fetcher.py` runs these checks in order; the
first that matches wins:

1. **No base ref** (push / manual) → `all`.
2. **Base ref unresolvable** → `all`.
3. **No merge-base** with the base (e.g. shallow clone, unrelated history) → `all`.
   A diff here would be wrong, so we never narrow on it.
4. **Commit message tag** `[test all]` / `[no filter]` anywhere on the branch → `all`.
5. **A changed file matches a run-all glob** (`COMMON_RUN_ALL_GLOBS` +
   the workflow's `extra_run_all_globs`) → `all`. These are files too central or
   too dynamic to narrow safely: CI scripts, build system, `csrc/`, `op_builder/`,
   `accelerator/`, shared fixtures (`tests/unit/common.py`, `tests/conftest.py`,
   `pytest.ini`), and core runtime hubs (`deepspeed/__init__.py`,
   `deepspeed/runtime/engine.py`, `deepspeed/comm/**`, `deepspeed/accelerator/**`, …).
6. **A deleted module is still imported** by a surviving file (a dangling import
   the graph can't follow) → `all`. A *clean* deletion (importers removed/updated
   in the same PR) does **not** trigger this.
7. Otherwise, **narrow via the import graph** (below). If nothing is impacted →
   `none`; if everything is → `all`; else → `subset`.

### The import graph

- Nodes are Python files under the package roots: `deepspeed/**` and the `unit`
  test-helper package at `tests/unit/**`.
- An edge `A → B` means "B imports A". The selector walks **backwards** from each
  changed file to every test that (transitively) imports it.
- **Opaque hub modules** (`OPAQUE_MODULES`: `deepspeed`, `deepspeed.comm`,
  `deepspeed.accelerator`): almost every test imports `unit.common`, which imports
  these. Their `__init__.py` files eagerly pull in huge subtrees, so if treated as
  normal nodes *any* `deepspeed/**` change would fan out to the whole suite. We
  therefore don't expand their `__init__` imports; instead, changes to the hubs
  themselves are caught by the run-all globs in step 5.
- **`conftest.py`** changes select every test under that conftest's directory.
- **New test files** are selected directly (they have no importers yet).

### Dynamic edges (`DYNAMIC_EDGES`)

Some dependencies are wired at runtime (monkey-patching, plugin/registry lookup,
JIT-loaded ops, `deepspeed.initialize()`-time `replace_module` injection), so a
test can depend on code it never `import`s. `DYNAMIC_EDGES` is a curated map of
`changed-file glob → extra test-path globs` that patches these blind spots. It is
additive on top of the static graph (and is only consulted if step 5 didn't
already short-circuit to `all`).


## Driving it (as a contributor)

### Preview what CI will run

The fetcher is pure stdlib — no DeepSpeed/torch install needed, just `git`:

```bash
# Selection for your branch vs. the base branch
python ci/tests_fetcher.py --base origin/master
cat ci/.test_selection/test_list.txt

# Explain *why* each test was selected (prints import chains)
python ci/tests_fetcher.py --base origin/master --explain
```

`--explain` output looks like:

```
deepspeed/shared.py impacts:
    tests/unit/v1/test_shared.py <- deepspeed/shared.py
    tests/unit/v1/moe/test_moe.py <- tests/unit/v1/moe/test_moe.py <- deepspeed/shared.py
```

### Escape hatches

- **Force the full suite for a push:** include `[test all]` (or `[no filter]`)
  anywhere in a commit message on the branch.
- **Touch an infra file:** any change to a run-all glob runs everything.
- **Found a missed test?** It's likely a runtime/dynamic dependency the static
  graph can't see — add a `DYNAMIC_EDGES` entry (see below) and/or report it.


## Changing it (as a maintainer)

All knobs live in `ci/tests_fetcher.py`. After any change, run the self-tests:

```bash
python ci/test_tests_fetcher.py          # standalone
# or: pytest ci/test_tests_fetcher.py
```

### Add a run-all trigger

Add a glob to `TestSelector.COMMON_RUN_ALL_GLOBS` (shared across workflows) or to
a specific workflow's `extra_run_all_globs`. Globs match repo-root-relative POSIX
paths; `dir/**` matches everything under `dir/`.

### Add a dynamic edge

Add to `TestSelector.DYNAMIC_EDGES`:

```python
DYNAMIC_EDGES = {
    # changed-file glob : test-path globs to pull in when it changes
    "deepspeed/module_inject/**": ("tests/unit/v1/moe/**",),
}
```

Keep entries conservative: too broad just wastes GPU time; too narrow misses
coverage. Prefer fixing it here over widening a run-all glob when only a slice of
tests is truly affected.

### Mark a module opaque

If a new universal hub starts fanning every change out to the whole suite, add it
to `OPAQUE_MODULES` and (usually) add the hub file itself to the run-all globs so
real changes to it still run everything.

### Add a new workflow

The engine is config-driven (`WORKFLOWS` registry of `WorkflowConfig`). To drive
another workflow:

1. Add an entry:
   ```python
   WORKFLOWS["my-workflow"] = WorkflowConfig(
       name="my-workflow",
       test_scopes=("tests/unit/v2",),               # dirs this workflow runs
       extra_run_all_globs=(".github/workflows/my-workflow.yml",),
   )
   ```
2. In that workflow's YAML, mirror `modal-torch-latest.yml`'s `collect-tests` job
   and call the fetcher with `--workflow my-workflow`.
3. Point the runner at `ci/.test_selection/test_list.txt`.
4. Add coverage to `ci/test_tests_fetcher.py` if the scope/behavior differs.

### Add a self-test

`ci/test_tests_fetcher.py` builds throwaway git repos (`TmpRepo`) from a synthetic
`BASELINE` tree and asserts the resulting `mode`/`tests`. Add a `test_*` function
for any new behavior; it runs both standalone and under pytest, and executes in
the `collect-tests` CI job, so a broken selector is caught before it mis-picks
tests.


## Security model

The workflow triggers on **`pull_request_target`**, so it runs in the base repo's
context and the `deploy` controller authenticates to Modal. The trust boundary is:

- Both jobs check out only the exact trusted base SHA (or the exact
  push/manual SHA), with persisted credentials, LFS, and submodules disabled.
  They never use the fork head with `actions/checkout`.
- `collect-tests` holds **no repository secrets**. Trusted base code fetches the
  public head and base repositories at their exact event SHAs, disables
  credentials, hooks, submodules, and LFS smudging, and rejects checkout
  symlinks that escape the candidate root. It treats the candidate tree only as
  git/AST data; it never imports, installs, builds, or executes candidate code.
- The selector logic and its self-tests always come from the trusted checkout.
  A PR's `ci/` changes still appear in the diff, so the base selector's `ci/**`
  run-all rule widens them to the full suite.
- The handoff is a fixed `all` / `subset` / `none` mode plus one bounded,
  validated regular file. Test paths must stay under `tests/unit/v1`, cannot be
  options or traversal paths, and are passed after pytest's `--` separator.
- `deploy` runs only the trusted controller. Candidate metadata is restricted
  to a public `owner/repository` and full 40-hex SHA; event values enter Python
  through environment variables, not workflow shell interpolation.
- The Modal service token remains in the controller process. The Sandbox gets
  no Modal, GitHub, Hugging Face, OIDC, or other secret; no local checkout,
  mount, volume, network filesystem, port, proxy, or workload identity is
  attached. The controller constructs a positive allowlist of non-sensitive
  git/pip environment flags instead of forwarding its environment.
- Candidate acquisition, dependency installation, DeepSpeed installation, and
  pytest all happen inside one isolated `l40s:2` Sandbox with a 3600-second
  server-side lifetime. Every subprocess uses structural arguments, and every
  nonzero clone/install/test status fails the check.
- The Sandbox retains outbound network access because it must reach public
  GitHub, package indexes, PyTorch wheels, and optionally Transformers. Those
  services do not have stable CIDRs suitable for the SDK's CIDR allowlist, so
  the containment control is the absence of secrets, identities, and mounts.
- The `pull_request_target` trigger types are `review_requested`,
  `ready_for_review`, and `synchronize`. Because `synchronize` re-runs on every
  push to an open PR (not just on a maintainer action), the maintainer review is a
  mitigation, **not** the trust boundary. Exact trusted base code plus Sandbox
  isolation is the primary protection.

**`merge_group` runs are a separate trust context.** GitHub runs a queued
entry's workflows from the merge-group commit — the PR's merged tree — so the
workflow YAML itself is candidate-controlled. The jobs restore the repo's
invariant by resolving every GitHub-side checkout to the trusted base revision
(`merge_group.base_sha`): the selector, the controller, and the accelerate
launcher all come from master there, and the merged candidate enters only as
validated git data (fetched by exact SHA into a separate root) or inside the
no-secret Modal Sandbox. The residual exposure — a queued PR rewriting the
workflow YAML itself to echo secrets — is inherent to GitHub's merge queue;
review PRs that touch `.github/workflows/*` with that in mind.

> **Consequence:** changes to `ci/*` (including `tests_fetcher.py` itself) take
> effect under `pull_request_target` only after they're **merged**. A PR that
> changes this launcher cannot prove its new PR-triggered end-to-end path by
> running itself. Before merge, use pure-stdlib/unit/static validation and, only
> when separately authorized credentials are available, a direct Modal smoke.
> Do not describe mock coverage as live Modal evidence.


## Failure modes & guarantees

The selector is built to **fail safe — to `all`, never to `none`**:

- Missing/unresolvable base, no merge-base, a parse error on a file, or **any
  unexpected exception** in the selector → it falls back to the full suite (the
  top-level handler in `main()` logs the traceback and sets `mode=all`).
- Checkout, selector self-test, list validation, write, or upload failures make
  `collect-tests` fail. `deploy` then enters its explicit failure guard, so a
  broken collector cannot pass the Required check.
- The only way to run *fewer* tests is a clean, well-understood narrow decision;
  every uncertain case widens to everything.
- Missing or invalid repository/SHA metadata, an inconsistent mode/list pair,
  and any failed Sandbox clone, install, version probe, or pytest command fail
  the controller. There is no moving-branch fallback.
- Once created, the task-owned Sandbox is terminated and its terminal state is
  observed on success and failure. Cleanup failure is itself a failure and is
  reported without hiding the primary command error. Forced controller loss is
  bounded by the Sandbox's one-hour server lifetime.
- `none` creates no Sandbox. `subset` and `all` create exactly one Sandbox; the
  GPU shape and lifetime are constants rather than PR or manual inputs.

Every run writes a summary to the GitHub job summary (mode, reason, and the
selected files) so the decision is auditable from the Actions UI. Candidate
text is control-escaped before logs/summaries and is never written to
`GITHUB_OUTPUT`.


## FAQ / troubleshooting

**My PR shows `mode=none` but I changed code.**
Either the change is non-Python / out of the workflow's scope, or your edits
aren't committed (the fetcher diffs *committed* history, `merge-base..HEAD`).

**A relevant test wasn't selected.**
Likely a runtime/dynamic dependency. Confirm with `--explain`, then add a
`DYNAMIC_EDGES` entry. As a stop-gap, push with `[test all]`.

**Everything runs even for a tiny change.**
You touched a run-all glob (CI/build/shared fixture/core runtime), or a hub module
fanned out. Check the job summary's `reason`. If a hub over-fans, consider
`OPAQUE_MODULES`.

**It ran the full suite and the summary says "shallow clone?" / "no merge-base".**
The exact event commits did not provide a usable merge-base. The collector
fetches the exact head and base SHAs into fixed refs; verify both event commits
are still publicly reachable. Do not replace this with a moving branch fallback.

**Why didn't this PR exercise its new `pull_request_target` controller?**
GitHub intentionally runs that event's workflow from the trusted base. The new
controller becomes the trusted code only after merge; before then, rely on the
focused static/unit evidence described in the security model. (The merge-queue
run *does* use the PR's merged controller, so `ci/*` changes are first
exercised live there.)
