### Batch Size Related Parameters

**Note:** <i>**train_batch_size**</i> must be equal to  <i>**train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu**</i> * <i>**gradient_accumulation_steps**</i> * number of GPUs. For simplicity, you can choose to only specify two of the three parameters, the last one will be inferred automatically by DeepSpeed.
{: .notice--warning}

<i>**train_batch_size**</i>: [integer]

| Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Example |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| The effective training batch size. This is the amount of data samples that leads to one step of model update. <i>**train_batch_size**</i> is aggregated by the batch size that a single GPU processes in one forward/backward pass (a.k.a., <i>**train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu**</i>),  the gradient accumulation steps (a.k.a., <i>**gradient_accumulation_steps**</i>), and the number of GPUs. Can be omitted if both <i>**train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu**</i> and <i>**gradient_accumulation_steps**</i> are provided. | `32`    |


<i>**train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu**</i>: [integer]

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Default                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Batch size to be processed by one GPU in one step (without gradient accumulation). Can be omitted if both <i>**train_batch_size**</i> and <i>**gradient_accumulation_steps**</i> are provided. | <i>**train_batch_size**</i> value |

<i>**gradient_accumulation_steps**</i>: [integer]

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Default |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Number of training steps to accumulate gradients before averaging and applying them. This feature is sometimes useful to improve scalability since it results in less frequent communication of gradients between steps. Another impact of this feature is the ability to train with larger batch sizes per GPU. Can be omitted if both <i>**train_batch_size**</i> and <i>**train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu**</i> are provided. | `1`     |


<i>**managed_gradient_accumulation**</i>: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Controls how gradient accumulation boundaries are managed. When `true`, DeepSpeed tracks micro-steps and applies the optimizer step only at the accumulation boundary, so `forward`/`backward`/`step` can be called symmetrically on every micro-batch. When `false`, micro-step tracking is disabled and the client is responsible for calling `step()` at the accumulation boundary; each `step()` finalizes the locally-accumulated gradients and applies an optimizer update. The `false` setting supports ZeRO stage 0/1/2/3 (and DDP), including ZeRO optimizer-state and parameter offload (CPU/NVMe). It is incompatible with pipeline parallelism and DeepCompile. ZeRO `overlap_comm` is supported only with ZeRO stage 2 (rejected for stage 0/1, where reduction is deferred to `step()`). | `true`  |



### Optimizer Parameters

<i>**optimizer**</i>: [dictionary]

| Fields | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Example                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| type   | The optimizer name. DeepSpeed natively supports **Adam**, **AdamW**, **Lamb**, and **Muon** optimizers (See [here](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/optimizers.html) for details) and will import other optimizers from [torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html). | `"Adam"`                     |
| params | Dictionary of parameters to instantiate optimizer. The parameter names must match the optimizer constructor signature (e.g., for [Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.Adam)).                                                                                                       | `{"lr": 0.001, "eps": 1e-8}` |

Muon optimizer is supported with ZeRO Stage 1, 2, and 3. To use Muon, set the optimizer name to `Muon`. The parameters applied for Muon are automatically determined by the matrix shape and name. For ZeRO Stage 3 with NVMe offloading, set `save_muon_momentum_buffer_in_memory` to `true` under `zero_optimization` to keep the Muon momentum buffer in GPU/CPU memory instead of swapping to NVMe.

Keeping Muon momentum in memory does not keep gradients resident: swappable ZeRO-3 subgroups still load their gradients from NVMe before computing Muon updates.

With ZeRO Stage 1/2 CPU optimizer offload, Muon gathers only locally owned gradient and momentum slices. Communication is chunked to a 64 MiB combined send/receive scratch budget per rank, independently of the 256 MiB buffer-cache limit. Full gradients and momentum are processed in batches targeting 64 MiB; a matrix exceeding that target is processed alone because Newton-Schulz requires the full matrix. These limits exclude Newton-Schulz workspaces and other training memory.

Muon supports the following params:

| "params" key   | Description                                                                                                          | Default   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| lr             | Learning rate for all parameters. Overridden by `muon_lr` / `adam_lr` if set.                                        | 0.001     |
| momentum       | Momentum coefficient for the Muon update.                                                                            | 0.95      |
| weight\_decay  | Weight decay (AdamW-style).                                                                                          | 0.0       |
| muon\_lr       | Learning rate override for Muon parameters. Defaults to `lr` if not set.                                             | -         |
| adam\_lr       | Learning rate override for non-Muon (Adam) parameters. Defaults to `lr` if not set.                                  | -         |
| torch\_adam    | Use torch Adam/AdamW for non-Muon parameters instead of the DeepSpeed Adam backend.                                  | false     |
| adam\_w\_mode | Use AdamW rather than Adam for non-Muon parameters.                                                                  | true      |
| ns\_method     | Newton-Schulz orthogonalization method: `"gram"` for Gram NS (~2x faster on rectangular matrices), `"standard"` for the original iteration. Use `"standard"` to fall back if you encounter convergence issues. | `"gram"`  |
| per\_head\_muon | Orthogonalize each attention head separately instead of the whole projection. See below. | false |

#### Per-head Muon

With `per_head_muon: true`, an attention projection shaped `[num_heads * head_dim, in_features]`
is viewed as `[num_heads, head_dim, in_features]` and Newton-Schulz runs on that batch, so each
head is orthogonalized against itself rather than sharing one update direction with every other
head. This is the split described by Kimi K3 ("Per-Head Muon") and GLM-5 ("Muon Split"). Off by
default; communication volume is unchanged.

What is tagged, and what deliberately is not:

| matrix | per-head | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q_proj` / `query` / `wq` | yes | blocked by the query head count |
| `k_proj` / `v_proj` / `key` / `value` / `wk` / `wv` | yes | blocked by the KV head count, which differs from the query count under GQA |
| MLA `q_b_proj`, `kv_b_proj` | yes | the two up-projections, whose per-head widths are `qk_nope + qk_rope` and `qk_nope + v_head_dim` rather than `head_dim` |
| `o_proj` and other output projections | no | the head structure is on the input dimension, so splitting dim 0 would cut across the wrong axis |
| fused `qkv_proj` / `query_key_value` / `c_attn` / `wqkv` | no | the three sections do not share a head count under GQA |
| MLA `q_a_proj`, `kv_a_proj_with_mqa` | no | down-projections mixing latent and rope components, with no head structure |
| linear-attention `q_proj` / `k_proj` / `v_proj` of a supported model (below) | yes | blocked by the head count the attention module was built with, which for hybrids such as Kimi-K3 is not `num_attention_heads * head_dim` |
| linear attention of any other model | no | not supported yet; see below |
| sparse-attention indexers (e.g. GLM-5.2's DSA indexer) | no | the indexer selects which keys attention will see; the split is defined on attention itself |

**Where the geometry comes from.** For standard attention and MLA, from the config: head counts
through `AutoTPMeta`, per-head widths from the fields the architecture defines. Linear attention
often keeps its geometry outside those fields, so it is supported per module, listed in
`_LINEAR_ATTENTION_OWNERS` in `deepspeed/__init__.py`. For a listed module, the head counts it was
built with are used, and the config is not consulted, since a config geometry can match the same
width by coincidence:

| model | linear-attention module | geometry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kimi-K3 | `KimiDeltaAttention` | `linear_attn_config` `num_heads` x `head_dim` |

Linear attention in any other model stays on the full-matrix path. To enable it, add the module's
class name to `_LINEAR_ATTENTION_OWNERS` with the model it was checked on, after confirming the
module exposes its head count and per-head width as attributes.

**The shape confirms the name.** A leaf name is treated as a claim about the layout, never as
proof of it. Every geometry the config makes plausible for that name is evaluated, and a
parameter is tagged only when its rows equal `num_heads * width` exactly for one of them. Two
geometries that confirm and agree on the head count are not a conflict; two that confirm and
disagree are, and the parameter is skipped with a warning.

**Tensor parallelism.** Column-parallel TP splits an attention projection on dim 0, which is
the axis the heads are on, so a rank holds whole heads and the per-head width is unchanged. That
makes the per-head split exact under TP: Newton-Schulz on a rank's heads is the same computation
whether the other ranks' heads are present or not. The head *count* is not invariant, so with
AutoTP the counts are re-resolved against the shards after partitioning; a shard whose rows are
not a multiple of the per-head width does not hold whole heads and stays on the full-matrix path.
A model that arrives already sharded by an external tensor-parallel implementation cannot be
tagged at all, because the config then describes a width no parameter has.

**The flag reports what it did.** Because it is an explicit opt-in, DeepSpeed raises at
`deepspeed.initialize` if it is enabled and no attention projection could be tagged, rather than
training on without it. Parameters that match an attention name but confirm no geometry are
reported as a warning and stay on the full-matrix path, so a hybrid model still gets per-head on
its recognized layers.

By default, non-Muon parameters use `FusedAdam`. When optimizer state is offloaded to the CPU, DeepSpeed selects `DeepSpeedCPUAdam`. This is the same backend selection used by the Adam and AdamW optimizer types.

  Example of <i>**optimizer**</i> with Adam

```json
"optimizer": {
    "type": "Adam",
    "params": {
      "lr": 0.001,
      "betas": [
        0.8,
        0.999
      ],
      "eps": 1e-8,
      "weight_decay": 3e-7
    }
  }
```
The Adam optimizer also supports the following two params keys/values in addition to the standard parameters from [torch.optim.Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html#Adam):

| "params" key  | Description                                                                 | Default |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| torch\_adam   | Use torch's implementation of adam instead of our fused adam implementation | false   |
| adam\_w\_mode | Apply L2 regularization (also known as AdamW)                               | true    |

Example of <i>**optimizer**</i> with Muon
If not set, muon_lr will default to lr.
```json
"optimizer": {
    "type": "Muon",
    "params": {
      "lr": 0.001,
      "momentum": 0.9,
      "weight_decay": 0.0,
      "muon_lr": 0.001,
      "ns_method": "gram"
    }
  },
  "zero_optimization": {
    "stage": 3,
    "save_muon_momentum_buffer_in_memory": true
  }
```

### Scheduler Parameters


DeepSpeed calls the `step()` method of the scheduler at every training step when `model_engine.step()` is executed.

***scheduler***: [dictionary]

| Fields | Value                                                                                                                      | Example                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| type   | The scheduler name. See [here](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schedulers.html) for list of support schedulers. | `"WarmupLR"`                                   |
| params | Dictionary of parameters to instantiate scheduler. The parameter names should match scheduler constructor signature.       | `{"warmup_min_lr": 0, "warmup_max_lr": 0.001}` |

Example of <i>**scheduler**</i>

```json
 "scheduler": {
      "type": "WarmupLR",
      "params": {
          "warmup_min_lr": 0,
          "warmup_max_lr": 0.001,

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Tile size for parameter processing to fit massive models (with trillions of parameters). Parameters are grouped into buckets of `sub_group_size` and each bucket is updated one at a time. When used with NVMe offload in ZeRO-Infinity, `sub_group_size` therefore controls the granularity in which model states are moved in and out of CPU memory from NVMe during the optimizer step. This prevents running out of CPU memory for extremely large models. | `1e9`   |

Most users can leave `sub_group_size` at its default value when not using NVMe offload. Consider changing it in the following cases:

1. Running into OOM during the optimizer step: reduce `sub_group_size` to lower the memory utilization of temporary buffers.
2. The optimizer step is taking a long time: increase `sub_group_size` to improve bandwidth utilization as a result of the increased data size.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Offload to page-locked (pinned) CPU memory. Pinning enables asynchronous, full-bandwidth CPU<->GPU DMA so parameter fetches during forward/backward overlap with compute. Pinned memory is non-swappable and counts against the host memlock limit (`ulimit -l`); on hosts with tight memlock limits this may fail at init or cause out-of-memory errors elsewhere — set to `false` in that case. | `true` |

### Optimizer offloading
Enabling and configuring ZeRO optimization of offloading optimizer computation to CPU and state to CPU/NVMe. CPU offloading is available with ZeRO stage 1, 2, 3. NVMe offloading is available only with ZeRO stage 3.
Note that if the value of "device" is not specified or not supported, an assertion will be triggered.
```json
  "offload_optimizer": {

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Offload to page-locked (pinned) CPU memory. Pinning is required for the asynchronous GPU->CPU gradient offload to run as a full-bandwidth DMA that overlaps with backward compute (needs `overlap_comm: true`). Pinned memory is non-swappable and counts against the host memlock limit (`ulimit -l`); on hosts with tight memlock limits this may fail at init or cause out-of-memory errors elsewhere — set to `false` in that case. | `true` |

**Note:** `pin_memory` now defaults to `true` for both `offload_param` and `offload_optimizer` (previously `false`). If you see out-of-memory errors after upgrading — especially on hosts with a low memlock limit (`ulimit -l`) — explicitly set `"pin_memory": false`.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Submit requests to storage device in an overlapped fashion without waiting for completion of earlier requests. | `true`  |

### Tensor Parallel (AutoTP)
Configure AutoTP tensor parallelism for training via the DeepSpeed config and hybrid TP + ZeRO. AutoTP supports ZeRO stages 0, 1, 2, and 3, including checkpoint save/load and universal checkpoint conversion. `deepspeed.tp_model_init()` remains supported for backward compatibility but is not required when `tensor_parallel` is set in the config.

When a HuggingFace model provides a built-in `tp_plan` (via `model.config.base_model_tp_plan`), DeepSpeed automatically detects and uses it. In this case, neither `preset_model` nor `partition_config` is required -- just set `autotp_size`. If `partition_config` is also provided, it takes precedence over the model's `tp_plan`.
```json
  "tensor_parallel": {
    "autotp_size": 4,
    "preset_model": "llama",
    "tp_overlap_comm": false,
    "vocab_parallel_lm_head": false,

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Optional model type filters (from `model.config.model_type`) for shared configs.                                | `null`  |

***ignore_unused_parameters***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Default |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Unused parameters in modules may be unexpected in static networks, but could be normal in dynamic networks. This controls whether or not training should terminate with an error message when unused parameters are detected. This is set to `True` by default, which means unused parameters are ignored and training continues. Now is just used in stage 2. | `True`  |

### Hybrid Engine

The Hybrid Engine (`DeepSpeedHybridEngine`) switches a model between training mode and DeepSpeed's inference kernels within a single training loop, which is what RLHF pipelines such as DeepSpeed-Chat use for the actor model.

```json
  "hybrid_engine": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_out_tokens": 512,
    "inference_tp_size": 1,
    "release_inference_cache": false,
    "pin_parameters": true,
    "tp_gather_partition_size": 8,
    "enable_cuda_graph": false
  }
```

***enable_cuda_graph***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Default |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Capture token generation into CUDA graphs. Generation issues on the order of a thousand kernel launches per token and is bound by CPU launch overhead rather than by the GPU, so replaying a captured graph removes most of the per-token cost. One graph is captured per decode position, and generated tokens are unchanged. | `false` |

`enable_cuda_graph` requires a pinned generation length (`min_new_tokens` equal to `max_new_tokens`) and `max_out_tokens` large enough to cover the longest generation. It is ignored, with a warning, when any of the following apply, since captured graphs would not stay valid:

* ZeRO stage 3, where parameters are gathered into fresh buffers for each generation
* `release_inference_cache: true`, which frees the buffers the graphs write into
* `inference_tp_size` greater than 1

The first generation after enabling captures one graph per decode position and is therefore slower; subsequent generations replay them.

### Expert Parallel (AutoEP)
Configure AutoEP expert parallelism for MoE models. AutoEP automatically detects MoE layers in HuggingFace models and replaces them with EP-enabled versions using TorchTitan's grouped GEMM kernels. Requires zero model code changes. Supports ZeRO stages 0, 1, 2, and constrained ZeRO Stage 3.
```json
  "expert_parallel": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoep_size": 4,
    "preset_model": "mixtral"
  }
```
<i>**expert_parallel**</i>: [dictionary]

| Description                                                                                | Default |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Enable AutoEP expert parallelism and configure MoE layer detection and replacement.        | `{}`    |

***enabled***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                 | Default |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Enable AutoEP. When `false`, all other expert_parallel settings are ignored. | `false` |

***autoep_size***: [integer]

| Description                                                                                        | Default |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Expert-parallel degree (number of ranks sharing expert computation). Must divide `world_size / pp_size`. `1` = all experts local (no AllToAll), useful for testing. | `1`     |

***expert_tensor_parallel_size***: [integer]

| Description                                                                                        | Default |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Reserved for expert tensor parallelism. AutoEP currently accepts only `1`; non-1 values are rejected. | `1`     |

***async_split_plan***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                                                                                | Default |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Overlap the pinned-memory split metadata transfer (device to host) with token sorting and packing. Expert-count AllToAll and split-size computation stay on the caller stream before packing; only the metadata copy uses a separate stream. The host waits for the metadata only immediately before payload dispatch. Requires CUDA, currently requires `tensor_parallel.autotp_size=1`, and has no effect when `autoep_size=1` or `comm_backend="deepep"`. | `false` |

This option reduces the host synchronization exposed by reading split sizes; it does not hide the expert-count AllToAll. Benchmark it with your target model, token count, EP size, and hardware before enabling it. For small workloads, stream/event overhead can outweigh the overlap benefit.

***preset_model***: [string]

| Description                                                                                                                            | Default |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Built-in model preset for MoE detection: `mixtral`, `qwen3_moe`, `qwen3_5_moe`, `deepseek_v2`, `deepseek_v3`. Determines router, expert, and weight naming patterns. | `null`  |

Built-in AutoEP presets describe DeepSpeed's router/expert/weight-pattern support for a model family.
Running a HuggingFace model also requires the installed Transformers package to expose the corresponding
config/model classes, `model.config.model_type` value, and fused expert layout. The tiny HuggingFace
smoke coverage used for this AutoEP surface produced the following version gates:

| Preset | Minimum Transformers version | Notes |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| `mixtral` | `5.0.0` |  |
| `qwen3_moe` | `5.0.0` | Also covers Qwen2-MoE when the installed Transformers build uses the validated fused expert layout. Qwen3-MoE classes appear in `4.51.3`, but the tested `4.x` builds do not match the validated AutoEP layout. |
| `qwen3_5_moe` | `5.2.0` | Requires the Qwen3.5 text-backbone `qwen3_5_moe_text` model type. For performance on Qwen3.5's Gated DeltaNet layers, install optimized kernels; see the [Hugging Face Transformers kernel loading docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/kernel_doc/loading_kernels) and the [Qwen FlashQLA blog](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=flashqla). |
| `deepseek_v2` | `5.0.0` | `load_balance_coeff` / expert-bias auxiliary-loss-free load balancing is not currently supported; non-null values are rejected. |
| `deepseek_v3` | `5.0.0` | `load_balance_coeff` / expert-bias auxiliary-loss-free load balancing is not currently supported; non-null values are rejected. |

***use_grouped_mm***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                    | Default |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Enable fused grouped GEMM for MoE expert computation. When enabled, the backend is selected automatically by device: on compute capability >= 9.0 (Hopper and newer) it uses `torch._grouped_mm`, which has a fused grouped-GEMM kernel; on compute capability < 9.0 (e.g. Ampere/Ada, where `torch._grouped_mm` falls back to a slow per-group loop) it uses a Triton grouped-GEMM kernel instead, when Triton is available. Set `use_grouped_mm=false` to use the sequential per-expert for-loop. `GroupedExperts` construction raises `RuntimeError` only if `use_grouped_mm=true` but neither `torch._grouped_mm` nor the Triton backend is available. | `true`  |

***disable_triton_grouped_mm***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                    | Default |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Controls the Triton grouped-GEMM backend selection when `use_grouped_mm=true`. When `false` (default), DeepSpeed uses the Triton grouped-GEMM kernel on devices where it is preferred (compute capability < 9.0, e.g. Ampere/Ada, where `torch._grouped_mm` falls back to a slow per-group loop) and Triton is available. Set `disable_triton_grouped_mm=true` to force the `torch._grouped_mm` path even on compute capability < 9.0 (falling back to the sequential for-loop if that operator is also unavailable). The Triton backend requires the `triton` package; when it is not installed, DeepSpeed uses `torch._grouped_mm` where available. | `false`  |

***moe_layer_pattern***: [string]

| Description                                                                                                   | Default |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Regex pattern matching MoE module names (e.g., `"model\\.layers\\.\\d+\\.mlp"`). When set, uses the custom preset path instead of auto-detecting from `model_type`. | `null`  |

***router_pattern***: [string]

| Description                                                                                  | Default |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Direct child attribute name for the experts module (e.g., `"experts"`). Not a regex.        | `null`  |

***score_func***: [string]

| Description                                                                                                              | Default  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Router scoring function: `"softmax"`, `"sigmoid"`, or `"auto"` (detect from `model.config.scoring_func` or use preset). | `"auto"` |

***score_apply***: [string]

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| When to apply router scores: `"pre"` (before experts), `"post"` (during combine), or `"auto"` (from preset). | `"auto"` |

***combine_impl***: [string]

| Description                                                                                                    | Default  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| How expert outputs are weighted by their router scores and reduced over top-k. `"auto"` resolves to `"weighted_sum"`. `"fused_weighted_sum"` is experimental and computes the same reduction in one Triton pass, without materializing the scattered assignment buffer or the `[tokens, top_k, hidden]` FP32 intermediate; it requires CUDA, Triton, bfloat16/float16 activations, `tensor_parallel.autotp_size=1`, `expert_tensor_parallel_size=1`, and a resolved `score_apply="post"`, and is rejected rather than silently ignored when any of those does not hold. `"legacy_bmm"` is a debug reduction retained for model-family verification. | `"auto"` |

***route_norm***: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                                     | Default |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Number of experts each token is routed to. An explicit integer overrides `top_k_attr` lookup. `"auto"` = read from `model.config` using `top_k_attr`. | `"auto"` |

***routed_scaling_factor***: [float|string]

#### Custom Model Example

For a model with non-standard naming conventions that is not covered by built-in presets:

```json
{
  "expert_parallel": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoep_size": 4,
    "moe_layer_pattern": "model\\.layers\\.\\d+\\.moe",
    "router_pattern": "router",
    "expert_pattern": "mlp_experts",
    "expert_w1": "w1",
    "expert_w2": "w2",
    "expert_w3": "w3",
    "num_experts_attr": "num_moe_experts",
    "top_k_attr": "moe_top_k",
    "has_shared_experts": false
  }
}
```

#### Preset Override Example

Use a built-in preset but override specific naming/weight fields for a fine-tuned model with renamed module paths:

```json
{
  "expert_parallel": {
    "enabled": true,
    "preset_model": "mixtral",
    "moe_layer_pattern": "model\\.layers\\.\\d+\\.moe",
    "router_pattern": "router",
    "expert_w1": "w1",
    "expert_w2": "w2"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `expert_storage` and `gate_bias` are auto-detected from model weights and cannot be overridden. `router_pattern`, `expert_pattern`, and `shared_experts_pattern` are direct child attribute names, not regex patterns.

**Constraints:**
- `autoep_size` must divide `num_experts` for all detected MoE layers
- AutoEP currently cannot be combined with AutoTP (`tensor_parallel.autotp_size > 1`); support is planned as follow-up work
- AutoEP with ZeRO Stage 3 is supported only without AutoTP, sequence parallelism, hpZeRO secondary tensor groups, non-1 `expert_tensor_parallel_size`, or quantized gradients
- ZeRO Stage 3 saves AutoEP checkpoints partition-natively and supports same-topology save/load, module-only loads, optimizer-state-skipping loads, and universal checkpoint conversion. Universal loads can resume at a different data-parallel world size, a different `autoep_size`, or both (when the target `autoep_size` divides the expert count), including weights-only/module-only loads from the converted `fp32.pt` parameter files

| Disable automatic Python cyclic garbage collection for the lifetime of a DeepSpeed engine. When `true`, DeepSpeed collects once after engine initialization, disables automatic cyclic GC, and restores the process's original automatic-GC state when the last engine using this option is destroyed. When `false`, DeepSpeed leaves the existing Python GC state unchanged. Applications that create cyclic Python objects during training should call `engine.collect_python_gc()` at a safe boundary such as after checkpointing. | `false` |

| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |

| Offloads activation checkpoint inputs to CPU. With `partition_activations` it offloads the partitioned activations; otherwise it uses an asynchronous pinned side-stream copy that overlaps the CPU transfer with compute. | `false` |

The asynchronous side-stream copy matches the peak-memory reduction of a blocking copy at a fraction of the step-time cost. On a single H200 with Qwen3-8B full-parameter SFT (`use_reentrant=False`), it lowers the GPU activation peak by up to ~14% at 32K sequence length while staying within ~2% of the no-offload step time, whereas a blocking offload is 1.4–1.9x slower.

| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**index_to_metric_path**</i>: [str] | Path to the index_to_metric_path file generated during offline data analysis. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**difficulty_type**</i>: [str] | During training, how to increase the max accepted difficulty. Currently support `value` (increase by absolute value) and `percentile` (increase by difficulty percentile). | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**clustering_type**</i>: [str] | Currently support `schedule_based` (cluster data based on the difficulty schedule (pacing function) below) and `single_cluster` (no clustering required and probably CL is achieved by data postprocessing, such as sequence length truncation). | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**min_difficulty**</i>: [integer] | Starting difficulty at first step. When difficulty_type=`value` the `min_difficulty` is an absolute difficulty value. When difficulty_type=`percentile` the `min_difficulty` is a difficulty percentile value. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**max_difficulty**</i>: [integer] | Final max difficulty. When difficulty_type=`value` the `max_difficulty` is an absolute difficulty value. When difficulty_type=`percentile` the `max_difficulty` is a difficulty percentile value. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**schedule_type**</i>: [str] | The difficulty schedule (pacing function) that defines how the max accepted difficulty increases from `min_difficulty` to `max_difficulty` during training. Currently support `fixed_linear`, `fixed_root`, `fixed_discrete`, and `custom`. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;**schedule_config**</i>: [dictionary] | Configs for the pacing function. When schedule_type=`custom` this dictionary is not necessary. Instead user needs to provide a callback function (via the `set_custom_curriculum_learning_schedule` API in deepspeed/runtime/engine.py) which will update the max accepted difficulty during training. Configs below are all belongs to `schedule_config`. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**total_curriculum_step**</i>: [integer] | How many steps the curriculum learning takes to go from min difficulty to max difficulty. Used by `fixed_linear` and `fixed_root` schedule. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**difficulty_step**</i>: [integer] | The max accepted difficulty level determined every step must be a multiple of this `difficulty_step`. This is used to ensure the use of NVIDIA Tensor Core acceleration (requires multiple of 8 (FP16) or 16 (INT8)). Used by `fixed_linear` and `fixed_root` schedule. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**root_degree**</i>: [integer] | The degree of the root function. Degree of 2 means square root and degree of 3 means cube root. Degree of 1 is equivalent to linear. Used by `fixed_root` schedule. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**difficulty**</i>: [list] | List of max accepted difficulty levels to be used during schedule. Used by `fixed_discrete` schedule. | N/A |
| <i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**max_step**</i>: [list] | List of which step to change max accepted difficulty level. Used by `fixed_discrete` schedule. | N/A |

### Communication Logging


DeepSpeed provides a flexible communication logging tool which can automatically detect and record communication operations launched via `deepspeed.comm`. NOTE: All logging communication calls are synchronized in order to provide accurate timing information. This may hamper performance if your model heavily uses asynchronous communication operations.

Once the logs are populated, they can be summarized with `deepspeed.comm.log_summary()`. For more detail and example usage, see the [tutorial](/tutorials/comms-logging/)




<i>**comms_logger**</i>: [dictionary]

| Fields | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |Default |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| enabled   | Whether communication logging is enabled. | `false` |
| verbose | Whether to immediately print every communication operation  | `false` |
| prof_all  | Whether to profile all operations. | `true` |
| debug  | Appends the caller function to each communication operation's `log_name`. | `false` |
| prof_ops  | A list of communication operations to log (only the specified ops will be profiled). | `[]` |


Example of recommended <i>**comms_logger**</i> configuration:

```json
"comms_logger": {
  "enabled": true,
  "verbose": false,
  "prof_all": true,
  "debug": false
}
```

Example of <i>**comms_logger**</i> configuration for logging specific operations only:

```json
"comms_logger": {
  "enabled": true,
  "verbose": false,
  "prof_all": false,
  "debug": false,
  "prof_ops": ["all_reduce", "all_gather"]
}
```
### Checkpoint options

```json
"checkpoint": {
    "tag_validation"="Warn",
    "load_universal"=false,
    "use_node_local_storage"=false,
    "parallel_write":{
        "pipeline_stage": false
    }
}
```

<i>**tag_validation**</i>: ["Ignore"|"Warn"|"Fail"]

| Description                                                                                                                            | Default |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Enables level of checking to ensure checkpoint tags are consistent across all ranks. Useful when restoring with different world sizes. |  "Warn" |

<i>**load_universal**</i>: [boolean]

| Description                            | Default |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Load the latest checkpoint for all.    | `false` |

<i>**use_node_local_storage**</i>: [boolean]

| Description                                                                                                                                                               | Default |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| If `true` DeepSpeed will store model parameter states and checkpoint states based on local rank allowing checkpoints to be loaded without access to a shared filesystem.  | `false` |

<i>**pipeline_stage**</i>: [boolean]

| Description                                                   | Default |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Use pipeline stages to parallelize the writing of checkpoints.| `false` |

### AutoSP options

DeepSpeed provides compiler-based optimization passes through the `compile` configuration. This includes enabling Ulysses-styled sequence paralllelism and a custom heuristic selective activation checkpointing pass. To enable Automatic Sequence Parallelism (AutoSP), configure the `compile` section:

```json
{
    "zero_optimization": {"stage": 0},
    "compile": {
        "deepcompile": true,
        "passes": ["autosp"],
    }
}
```

### AutoTP options

The `autotp` pass emits AutoTP's tensor-parallel collectives into the compiled graph instead of
running them from inside the injected `LinearLayer` / `LinearAllreduce` modules. The model is
partitioned by the regular AutoTP path, so `tensor_parallel.autotp_size` must be greater than 1
and the pass reuses the same tensor-parallel group.

```json
{
    "zero_optimization": {"stage": 0},
    "tensor_parallel": {"autotp_size": 4},
    "compile": {
        "deepcompile": true,
        "passes": ["autotp"],
    }
}
```

<i>**passes**</i>: [array of strings]

| Description                                                                       | Default |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| List of compiler passes to apply. Currently supported: `["autosp", "autotp"]`.    | `[]`    |



### DeepCompile activation offload

These fields live under `compile` and apply when DeepCompile activation offload is scheduled.
The offload pass is **not** in the default DeepCompile schedule; enable it only via a custom
`schedule=` when calling DeepCompile init. Setting `offload_activation` alone has no effect.

<i>**offload_activation**</i>: [boolean]

| Description | Default |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Config field for DeepCompile activation offload. Requires a custom schedule that includes the offload pass; not enabled by the default `init_z3` / `init_z1` schedules. | `false` |

<i>**offload_activation_pin_memory**</i>: [boolean]

| Description | Default |
| ----------- | ------- |
| When activation offload runs, pin host buffers via ATen `pinned_memory` (Torch host pin). Does **not** use `DS_PIN_MEMORY_BACKEND`. Defaults to `true`; set `false` under tight memlock limits (`ulimit -l`). | `true` |

### Data Type options

```json
"data_types": {
    "grad_accum_dtype"=["fp32"|"fp16"|"bf16"]
    }
}
```

<i>**grad_accum_dtype**</i>: ["fp32"|"fp16"|"bf16"]

| Description                                                                                                   | Default |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------- |
| Specifies the data type in which to do gradient accumulation. If None the default is to match the model type. |  None   |
