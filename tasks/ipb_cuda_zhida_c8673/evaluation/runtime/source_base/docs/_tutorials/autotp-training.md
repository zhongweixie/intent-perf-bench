## Introduction

The AutoTP Training API enables hybrid parallelism by combining:
- **Tensor Parallelism (TP)**: Split model weights across GPUs within a node
- **Data Parallelism (DP)**: Replicate model across GPU groups
- **ZeRO Optimization**: Memory-efficient optimizer states (Stage 0, 1, or 2)

Tensor parallelism (TP) splits the computations and parameters of large layers
across multiple GPUs so each rank holds only a shard of the weight matrix. This
is an efficient way to train large-scale transformer models by reducing per-GPU
memory pressure while keeping the layer math distributed across the TP group.


## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

AutoTP training can be enabled entirely through the DeepSpeed config. When
`tensor_parallel` is set in the config, `deepspeed.initialize(...)` applies
AutoTP sharding during engine initialization, so the training loop itself does
not change.

```python
import torch
import deepspeed

# 1. Create your model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B")

# 2. Define the DeepSpeed config with tensor_parallel settings
ds_config = {
    "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
    "zero_optimization": {"stage": 2},
    "bf16": {"enabled": True},
    "tensor_parallel": {"autotp_size": 4},
}

# 3. Initialize DeepSpeed with AutoTP + ZeRO
engine, optimizer, _, _ = deepspeed.initialize(
    model=model,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    config=ds_config,
    mpu=mpu  # Model parallel unit (optional if you provide tp_group elsewhere)
)

# 4. Train as usual
for batch in dataloader:
    outputs = engine(input_ids=batch["input_ids"], labels=batch["labels"])
    engine.backward(outputs.loss)
    engine.step()
```

Compatibility note: For backward compatibility, you can still call
`set_autotp_mode(training=True)` and `deepspeed.tp_model_init(...)`, but they
are not required when the DeepSpeed config provides the necessary
`tensor_parallel` settings.

### Preset-based Sharding

If your model matches a built-in preset, set `tensor_parallel.preset_model` in the DeepSpeed config:

```json
{
    "train_batch_size": 8,
    "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
    "bf16": { "enabled": true },
    "zero_optimization": { "stage": 2 },
    "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "preset_model": "llama"
    }
}
```

For the list of available presets, see [supported models](/code-docs/training#autotp-supported-models).



## HuggingFace tp_plan Support

Many HuggingFace models (e.g. Llama, Qwen, Gemma2) ship with a built-in
`base_model_tp_plan` in their model config that describes how each layer
should be partitioned for tensor parallelism. DeepSpeed can automatically
detect and use this plan, so you do not need to configure `preset_model` or
`partition_config` for these models.

When `tensor_parallel` is set in the DeepSpeed config, the initialization
follows this priority:

1. **Custom `partition_config`** (highest): User-defined regex patterns.
2. **HuggingFace `tp_plan`**: Automatically extracted from
   `model._tp_plan` or `model.config.base_model_tp_plan`.
3. **AutoTP heuristics** (lowest): Built-in parser based on module structure.

For models that define a `tp_plan`, you only need a minimal config:

```json
{
    "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
    "zero_optimization": { "stage": 2 },
    "bf16": { "enabled": true },
    "tensor_parallel": { "autotp_size": 4 }
}
```

DeepSpeed will read the model's `tp_plan` at initialization and convert it to
internal partition rules. The supported types are `colwise`, `rowwise`,
and `colwise_gather_output`(`colwise_rep`). The gathered column styles shard
the linear weight along its output dimension and AllGather the local output
shards so every tensor-parallel rank receives the complete output. For untied
output layers, the output dimension does not need to be divisible by
`autotp_size`; DeepSpeed uses uneven local shards and gathers back to the
original logical output size.

Gathered column parallelism currently supports untied output layers. If an
output layer such as `lm_head` shares the same runtime `Parameter` object with
an embedding, DeepSpeed leaves both modules replicated and applies tensor
parallelism to the remaining matched layers. This preserves the tie without
silently cloning the weight, but does not reduce the embedding or output-layer
memory footprint. A coupled vocabulary-parallel embedding is required to shard
the tied weight and is not yet implemented. This fallback uses actual `Parameter`
identity rather than model configuration metadata such as `tie_word_embeddings`.

Additional HuggingFace types such as `local_colwise` and `local_rowwise` are
not yet handled and fall back to AutoTP preset-based partitioning.

For an untied `lm_head` or `embed_out`, an explicit `row` partition rule also
supports eager training with a replicated input. The head slices the input to
match its weight shard, reduces the complete output, and reconstructs the full
input gradient across tensor-parallel ranks. Bias stays replicated; uneven
hidden dimensions and both flattened and sequence-shaped inputs are supported.
The default training output-head layout remains column parallel. Explicit row
training rejects tied weights and reshaped/non-input-dimension shards rather
than silently breaking a parameter tie. Deferred DeepCompile collectives are
not supported for this output-head path.

If you need to override the model's built-in `tp_plan`, provide a
`partition_config` in the DeepSpeed config -- it takes precedence.


## Vocabulary-parallel LM Loss

Causal language models normally gather the complete `lm_head` output before
computing cross entropy. To keep an untied output vocabulary sharded, enable
`vocab_parallel_lm_head`:

```json
{
    "train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu": 1,
    "zero_optimization": { "stage": 2 },
    "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "vocab_parallel_lm_head": true
    }
}
```

DeepSpeed then keeps `lm_head` (or `embed_out`) local to each TP rank and
installs a pure-PyTorch distributed causal-LM loss through the model's
`loss_function` hook. The loss computes a numerically stable distributed
log-sum-exp and target lookup without gathering vocabulary logits. Uneven
vocabulary shards are supported.

For optional fused CE, install `liger-kernel>=0.8.1` and set
`tensor_parallel.vocab_parallel_ce_backend` to `"liger"` alongside
`vocab_parallel_lm_head`. The default remains `"torch"`, with no Liger dependency.
The Liger backend accepts nonempty accelerator logits in FP32, FP16, or BF16 with
equal vocabulary shards behind an explicit tensor-parallel group, on any accelerator
whose Triton support the DeepSpeed accelerator reports. Uneven shards, a missing
tensor-parallel group, and unsupported layouts use the PyTorch backend on every TP
rank. This fuses CE, not the linear projection: local logits are still
materialized. Liger supports one first-order backward per forward; retained-graph
second backward and higher-order gradients raise an error rather than reusing
its overwritten gradient buffer. Select `"torch"` for those workloads.

Only an `nn.Linear` whose final name segment is `lm_head` or `embed_out` is
supported. If no such head exists, initialization fails instead of quietly
falling back to an ordinary gathered head. When `partition_config` or a
HuggingFace `tp_plan` also describes that head, `vocab_parallel_lm_head` takes
precedence and a warning names the superseded partitioning.

This option requires an untied output head and a model with a writable
`loss_function` hook. Models that share the output weight with the input
embedding must continue using gathered output until coupled vocabulary-parallel
embedding support is available. The head's vocabulary must also be at least as
large as `autotp_size`; smaller vocabularies fail at startup instead of leaving
TP ranks with empty shards. The flag itself is the only trigger: a `colwise`
`lm_head` specification with local output keeps the previous behavior of
returning rank-local logits without installing the distributed loss.

The lower-level `vocab_parallel_cross_entropy` API also accepts an explicit
sequence-parallel group. With `reduction="none"`, callers may return local token
losses or gather them along sequence dimension 0. `sum` and `mean` reduce over
the supplied SP group. TP and SP may be combined with explicit orthogonal
process groups, but AutoTP does not currently construct a combined TP x SP mesh
automatically.

Gathered sequence losses have two backward conventions. The general
`vocab_parallel_cross_entropy(..., gather_sequence_loss=True)` API sums the
gradient contributions from every SP rank before returning each rank's local
slice. The compatibility wrapper `vocab_sequence_parallel_cross_entropy`
preserves its legacy behavior and returns only the corresponding local slice of
the gathered loss gradient. New callers that consume or reduce the gathered
loss on every SP rank should use the general API; existing callers can retain
the wrapper without changing their gradient scale. Both gathered forms require
an explicit `sp_group`.

Under DeepSpeed's Ulysses sequence-parallel engine, the installed loss must keep
its default sequence-parallel settings (no `sp_group`): the engine aggregates
each shard's mean itself, weighted by the shard's valid-token count, so an
additional SP reduction would double-count tokens. Pass an `sp_group` only when
this loss is the sole aggregation over a manually constructed TP x SP mesh.


## Custom Patterns

If you are training a custom model, define regex-based patterns and partition rules in `tensor_parallel.partition_config`:

```json
{
    "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "partition_config": {
            "use_default_specs": false,
            "layer_specs": [
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.o_proj\\.weight$", ".*\\.down_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "row"
                },
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.[qkv]_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "column"
                },
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.gate_up_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "column",
                    "shape": [2, -1],
                    "partition_dim": 0
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Custom Layer Specifications

For models not covered by presets, define custom layer specs:

```json
{
    "tensor_parallel": {
        "autotp_size": 4,
        "partition_config": {
            "use_default_specs": false,
            "layer_specs": [
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.o_proj\\.weight$", ".*\\.down_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "row"
                },
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.[qkv]_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "column"
                },
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.gate_up_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "column",
                    "shape": [2, -1],
                    "partition_dim": 0
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Fused Layers with Unequal Sub-parameters (GQA)

For Grouped Query Attention with different Q/K/V sizes:

```json
{
    "tensor_parallel": {
        "partition_config": {
            "layer_specs": [
                {
                    "patterns": [".*\\.qkv_proj\\.weight$"],
                    "partition_type": "column",
                    "shape": [[q_size, kv_size, kv_size], -1],
                    "partition_dim": 0
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Limitations

1. **Ranks beyond the key/value head count stay idle**: Attention heads are distributed whole, and the distribution may be uneven -- 6 key/value heads over 4 ranks becomes 2/2/1/1, and a fused QKV weight is cut on the same head boundaries rather than inside a head. With more ranks than key/value heads, for example an 8-head model at `autotp_size=16`, the surplus ranks receive no attention weights at all. The result is still correct, because those ranks contribute zeros to the row-parallel all-reduce, but they do no attention work; AutoTP logs a warning instead of replicating heads to fill them. Hidden and vocabulary dimensions do not need to be divisible by the tensor parallel size: uneven shards are carried through save, conversion and restore via per-TP-rank shapes and widths.

2. **Vocabulary-parallel tied weights**: `vocab_parallel_lm_head` requires an untied output projection and a writable model `loss_function` hook, and a vocabulary at least as large as the tensor-parallel size. Coupled sharding of a tied input embedding and output projection is not yet implemented.

3. **Combined TP and SP orchestration**: The vocab-parallel loss supports explicit orthogonal TP and SP groups, but AutoTP does not currently construct a combined TP x SP process mesh automatically.

4. **Cross-topology universal restore**: Loading a universal checkpoint back into a topology with a *different* tensor-parallel degree goes through DeepSpeed's Megatron-style model-state loader, which is not AutoTP-aware; prefer same-topology restore when changing world size.
